    <h2>A Look Into Tesla's Life</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>July 10, 1856: </strong>Tesla, of Serbian descent, was born during a lightening storm at the time of the Austrian Empire, which is modern day Croatia.  Upon his birth, the midwife told his mother, "he will be a child of the storm", and his mother countered prophetically, "no, of the light." </li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong >1873: </strong>He contracted Cholera and almost died multiple times- during this time, his father abandoned his demand that Tesla become an Orthodox priest like him, and promised to send him to the best engineering school. He was a remarkable student & was able to calculate complex math problems in his head. Piqued by his physics professor, he became very interested in the phenomena of electricity.</li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>1875: </strong>At the age of 19, Tesla began attending the Austrian Polytechnic University but later withrew from school. He traveled to different areas of Europe including Budapest and Paris, where he began his work early on with The Continental Edison Company. </li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>June 1884: </strong>Tesla arrives in New York City with 4 cents in his pocket and a letter of recommendation from his employer in Paris, to work for Thomas Edison himself. He worked for Edison, being told he would earn $50,000 to work on a series of engineering problems related to Edison's DC generation plants. When Tesla achived his tasks & developed an even better form of current, AC power, he was not paid. Tesla left the Edison Company after this only to find himself realizing  he must put his talents and education to better use.</li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>1880's- 1890's: </strong>A war on currents ensued between Nikola Tesla & Thomas Edison- AC power vs DC power. During Tesla's time in New York City, he developed many inventions and patents, including the alternating current induction motor, Tesla coils & the remote control. His work contributed to the start of the radio and developing x-ray imaging. Most of the patents and work done on the Niagra Falls hydroelectirc stations- the world's first and largest AC power plant- were contributed by Nikola Tesla and his work with Westinghouse. In March of 1895, Tesla lost a majority of his work and his lab in a fire in New York City, in the building his lab was in.</li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>1899- 1901: </strong>Tesla decided to move his work and lab to Colorado Springs, CO where he was at a higher elevation and could work with much larger coils. Here, he once drew so much power that he caused a regional power outage! He also claimed to detect signals from other planets & extraterrestrials in space.        </li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>1901: </strong>Tesla returned back to New York where he continued his work. During this time, he hoped to demonstrate wireless transmisssion across the Atlantic through the Wardenclyffe Tower. Due to lack of funding from J.P. Morgan, he was not the first one to transmit signals, rather it was Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian inventor. Marconi has been improperly credited as the inventor of radio after using 17 of Tesla's patents and his ideas. </li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> For the remainder of Tesla's life, he lived out his days in NYC, welcoming solitude and working on his ideas and inventions. It is thought that he was a high functioning autistic with OCD and an obsession with the number 3- he rarely slept and worked often. He had many famous friends, including Mark Twain, but  towards the end of his life, found a special affinity in the pigeons of New York. </li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>1931: </strong>Tesla graced the cover of TIME magazine for his 75th birthday. After this time, he created the "death ray or peace ray" which is a motor that would run on cosmic rays and a be potential weapon for war. He also was said to be working on non-Einsteinian physics that would supply a new form of energy.</li>
          <li class= "in-line-height"> <strong>January 7, 1943: </strong>Tesla died alone in a New York hotel room, potentially related to having severely injured himself in 1937, after he was hit by a car.   Shortly after his death, the FBI ordered the Alien Property Custodian to sieze all of Tesla's work and belongings. In 1952, Tesla's nephew was able to get what was left of Tesla's estate, shipped to Belgrade, Serbia where his ashes rest in a gold-plated sphere in the Nikola Tesla Museum.</li>

     <p id= "closing-p">Tesla held over 300 patents, spoke 8 languages and is the modern inventor of the most well known source of power today- alternating current. He had a brain so powerful and imaginative, that he was able to produce perfect drawings of his inventions from memory. Had his inventions been seen as a way to lead a progressive future and shift in humanity, our world would be a lot different today.</p>
